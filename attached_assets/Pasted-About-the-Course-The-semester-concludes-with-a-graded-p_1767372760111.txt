About the Course
The semester concludes with a graded project where the candidate must demonstrate practical skills and competence from courses in the first semester. Candidates work independently or in a group on a project, which must be planned, documented, and executed according to project criteria. The aim is to carry out a practical project consisting of elements from the previous courses. The candidate also prepares a project plan and an individual reflection report documenting the process and choices made along the way.

The project challenges candidates to use and combine accumulated competence from the first semester and showcase how they can complete larger projects, either individually or across disciplinary boundaries. Candidates are challenged to think and work holistically, which provides a solid platform for further learning and understanding of the data analysis field.
