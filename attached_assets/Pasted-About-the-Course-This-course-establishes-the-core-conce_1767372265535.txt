About the Course
This course establishes the core concepts of decision-making techniques applied to relevant data models. Candidates will be provided with real world before-after scenarios and use case studies to engage their developing analytical mindsets. Candidates will further solidify their theoretical understanding of applied techniques as well as refining their decision-making skills to understand which analytical method to apply to maximize results. Candidates will learn the data analysis lifecycle, techniques for data analysis (specifically Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive, and Diagnostic), and engage in discussions between qualitative and quantitative.

This course teaches the core techniques to creating a successful data lifecycle from start to finish. Candidates are taught the concept of data models and the use of data subsets to isolate problem domains for further analysis. It is in this course where key performance indicators are introduced, which are essential heuristics used in industry to track data behaviour.
