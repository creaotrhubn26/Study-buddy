About the Course
This course introduces candidates to important visualization and graphing techniques which will enable their work to be represented using graphical illustrations. Data visualization is an important step to ensuring colleagues can interpret results at a glance without prior analytical knowledge. Candidates will be challenged to create intuitive graphs to represent their findings in a professional setting using relevant graphical generation and editing software. Additionally, candidates will make use of presentation software such as Microsoft PowerPoint to orally deliver their analysis to both a technical and non-technical business audience.

This course will provide candidates with the practical knowledge and skills to interpret and present the results of data analysis of any given datasets in visual contexts. Candidates will learn the universal design paradigm, thus providing them with the insights too create visually appealing, but also accessible graphics to ensure their findings are presentable to both technical and non-technical audiences.
