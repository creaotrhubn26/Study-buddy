About the Course
This course provides the knowledge of reviewing the outcomes achieved from using statistical tools and model choices. Candidates will learn technical skills to review, assess, and appraise the results of successful analytical models. Additionally, candidates will also learn how to identify faulty results and apply problem solving techniques to express feedback and construct an understanding for iterative error elimination. This course relies on the candidate passing the previous semester’s required grade to ensure a foundation level understanding of data is achieved before key analytical skills are taught.

The main goal of this course it to teach candidates how to evaluate the outcomes of a given data model. This is a fundamental skill candidates must learn through practice; thus, this course is quintessential to ensure candidates learn the advanced skills and techniques required to do so. This course also aims to introduce candidates to broader technical concepts that are used in industry to evaluate complex problems with multiple possible outcomes.
